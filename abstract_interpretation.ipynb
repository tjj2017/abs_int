    "Traditionally, SPARK programs have been analysed by the Examiner using data flow and information flow analysis.  This study does not consider the proof features of the Examiner (VCG generator) but rather investigates whether the same or better results to flow analysis can be achieved using abstract interpretation. Better results may be achievable using abstract interpretation as it might be possible to determine some non-executable paths and exclude them from the analysis.  To achieve this goal, two of the more advanced techniques of abstract interpretation - variable analysis and path analysis are needed. \n",

    "## Abstract Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract interpretation is commonly viewed as having three stages:\n",
    "1. Translate\n",
    "2. Merge\n",
    "3. Widen\n",
    "\n",
    "These three stages are applied to each statement of the given source text until it has been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translate converts a statement into a simple model representing the statement.  Merge takes the model of the statement and the abstractions of the immediately preceding statements (in general, there may be more than one due to gotos if statements and loops) and merges them into a single abstraction for the statement.  The abstraction is an approximation of the state at the statement.  Generally, it consists of an entry for each variable and an approximation of the range of values that variable may have at the statement.  The Widen stage is typically used after loops to widen the approximate range of possible values a variable may have to represent executing the loop multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is interesting about these stages is that they can be adapted to suit a number of different analyses but still fit within the framework of calling each of the three stages for each statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance,  constant analysis is may be used to obtain an approximation of the range of values a variable may have at a particular statement based on the value of constants within the source text.  Variable analysis is similar but more complex based on the expressions assigned to variables within the source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform abstract interpretation, an abstract model of the source text needs to be constructed consisting of a model of each statement (the translation) and a sequence of abstractions representing each of the previous statements.  Merge consolidates the immediately preceding statements with the model of the current statement to obtain an abstraction for the current statement which is appended to the sequence.  Merging is a simple operation when the statement has only one immediate predecessor but becomes a little more complex around if statements, loops and the targets of goto statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "SPARK 2005 (SPARK Classic) has the advantage over general programming language in that, other than in a loop, an immediately preceding statement cannot be later in text than the current statement, simplifying the sequence of preceding statements that need to be maintained.  As SPARK is modular each subprogram is essentially self-contained and only variables used within the subprogram need to be in the abstractions, very little extra context has to be maintained and the sequence of abstractions can be discarded after completing the analysis of the subprogram.\n"

    "## SPARK 2005 Examiner Flow Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The Examiner performs analyses based on flow relations.  The flow relations facilitate regular data flow analysis but provide further deeper analysis. If dependency relations are provided for subprograms, the Examiner performs an information-flow analysis whereby the output - input dependencies specified for a subprogram are checked against the program statements of the subprogram.  The information flow analysis tends to be less widely used than it once was since formal proofs of various properties of a subprogram have become much more practical with modern provers.  Information flow is still used in security analysis, but, ideally, it should be more flexible than currently provided by the Examiner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, this study will concentrate on the analyses provided by the Examiner, excluding information-flow analysis.  In the following subsections, the warnings and errors potentially reported by the Examiner concerning flow analysis (but not information flow) are taken from the SPARK Examiner User Manual 2012.  The Examiner has a severity notation scheme using 3 leading characters.  Warnings begin with \"---\", conditional errors with \"???\" and unconditional errors with \"!!!\".\n",

    "!!! Flow Error :10: Assignment to XXX is ineffective.\n",
    "This message always relates to a procedure call or an assignment to a record. The variable XXX may be an actual parameter corresponding to a formal one that is exported; otherwise XXX is an exported global variable of the procedure. The message indicates that the updating of XXX, as a result of the procedure call, has no effect on any final values of exported variables of the calling subprogram. Where the ineffective assignment is expected (e.g. calling a supplied procedure that returns more parameters than are needed for the immediate purpose), it can be a useful convention to choose a distinctive name, such as \"Unused\" for the actual parameter concerned. The message \"Assignment to Unused is ineffective\" is then self-documenting.\n",
    "\n",

    "The expression is either a case expression or a condition (Boolean-valued expression) associated with an if-statement, not contained in a loop statement. The message indicates that the expression takes the same value whenever it is evaluated, in all program executions. Note that if the expression depends on values obtained by a call to another other subprogram then a possible source for its invariance might be an incorrect annotation on the called subprogram.\n",

    "In these cases the (loop) exit condition occurs in an iteration scheme, an exit statement, or an if-statement whose (unique) sequence of statements ends with an unconditional exit statement - see the SPARK Definition. The concept of loop stability is explained in Section 4.4 of Appendix A. A loop exit condition which is stable of index 0 takes the same value at every iteration around the loop, and with a stability index of 1, it always takes the same value after the first iteration. Stability with indices greater than 0 does not necessarily indicate a program error, but the conditions for loop termination require careful consideration.\n",

    "The expression, occurring within a loop, is either a case expression or a condition (Boolean- valued expression) associated with an if-statement, whose value determines the path taken through the body of the loop, but does not (directly) cause loop termination. Information flow analysis shows that the expression does not vary as the loop is executed, so the same branch of the case or if statement will be taken on every loop iteration. An Index of 0 means that the expression is immediately stable, 1 means it becomes stable after the first pass through the loop and so on. The stability index is given with reference to the loop most closely-containing the expression. Stable conditionals are not necessarily an error but do require careful evaluation; they can often be removed by lifting them outside the loop.\n",

    "# Abstract Interpretation of Definedness\n",
    "\n",
    "The following description is taken from HandWiki.org:\n",
    "In mathematics, an expression is called well-defined or unambiguous if its definition assigns it a unique interpretation or value. Otherwise, the expression is said to be not well-defined, ill-defined or ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ada, and, therefore, SPARK are imperative programming languages and, unlike mathematical varables, Ada variables may have different values during their lifetime.  Some of these values may not be well-defined.  The same variable, in Ada, may be well-defined or ill-defined at different parts of the program.  Ada has a special case of ill-defined, ***uninitalized***, when a variable is unassigned which can happen when the variable is declared without an initialization.  Clearly an uninitialized variable is ill-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions, in Ada, are ***evaluated***.  When an ill-defined variable in an expression is evaluated, the value of the expression is ill-defined.  In SPARK, expressions do not have side-effects and, therefore, an evaluation of an expression in which all the variables are well-defined will render a mathematically well-defined value for the expression.  Note, however, the expression is not necessarily ***valid*** in Ada as evaluation may lead to an accumulator overflow or produce a value which is out of range for its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ada refers to the act of assigning a value to a variable as ***assignment*** and, in SPARK, assignment to a variable is by an initialisation expression, an assignment statement or by a call of a procedure specified with mode **in out** or **out** global variables or formal parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract interpretation uses an abstraction based on an approximation of the range of values a variable may have at a given statement.  In variable definedness we are concerned whether a variable has been assigned a (preferably well-defined) value but are not concerned with the precise value.  A representation of the values of definedness may be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a SPARK program the basic unit of analysis is a subprogram (although some analysis of packages tasks and packages is required) and in this document only analysis of subprograms is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definedness Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a model to represent the values of definedness. Definedness is not concerned with the actual value of a variable, only whether it is well-defined.  Definedness is basically binary, well-defined or ill-defined, but as noted, Ada has the special case of ill-defined, uninitialized, which can be considered as another value. Another value can be added which is a special case of well-defined, which represents the value of a well-defined variable that has been evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the model of definednes the values that a variable may have is specified below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Values of Definedness\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Uninitialized*** -- The value of an uninitialized variable\n",
    "2. ***Ill***           -- The value of an ill-defined variable\n",
    "4. ***Well***          -- The value of a well-defined variable\n",
    "5. ***Used***          -- The value of a well-defined variable which has been evaluated\n",
    "\n",
    "If a definedness value is not ***Uninitialized*** or ***Ill***, it is considered a well-defined value. A well-defined value is not necessarily a valid value in the Ada sense as the value could be out of range and, therefore, an invalid value.  A more sophisticated abstract interpretation technique may be able to approximate the range of actual (rather than definedness) values a variable may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model of Program Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The statements of a subprogram evaluate expressions or assign values to variables suggesting a simple model of a statement for defindness of a sequence of ***Eval*** and ***Assign*** actions. The translation phase will convert a program statement into this simple model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements of a program may also indicate a branch, e.g., through an if statement, and a rejoining of a branch, at the end of the statement, e.g., the end if.  The definedness model must take account of these branches and to correctly merge the abstractions of statements from different branches.  In Classic SPARK branching can only occur through, if, case and loop statements, but conditional computation can be also controlled by using **and then** and **or else** operators.  Ada 2012 onwards introduced conditional expressions which introduce further branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple defindeness abstract interpretation model it will not be possible determine which branch of a conditional expression will be taken as this would require a more sophiticated analysis.  Each branch of a conditional expression only contains a (possibly conditional) expression.\n",

    "Definedness analysis also needs to know the start and end of a subproram as the is the basic unit in SPARK analysis.\n",

A function result nay be modelled as an **out** parameter.  A subprogram can have many parameters and globals, leading to the model of a statement potentially having multiple uses of variables (possibly of the same variable) and multiple assignments to variables.  SPARK ant-aliasing rules guarantee all variables assigned in a single statement are unique.\n",

    "\n",
    "The proposed translation first considers all of the variables evaluated by the statement and then those that are assigned by the statement.

    "Each statement of a subprogram has an abstraction representing all the variables that are evaluated or assigned by the subprogram and their state on completion of execution of the statement.  Commonly, in abstract interpretation, the state of a each variable is represented by an approximation of the range of values that the variable may have at a statement.  For definedness, the maximum range is [Uninitialized, Used]. An order is placed on the definedness values: ***Uninitialized*** < ***Ill*** < ***Well*** < ***Used***.  The abstraction of a statement, S, is formed by merging the abstractions of all its immediately preceding statements and applying the effects of executing S to the merged statements. In this document the abstraction representing a statement is called a STatement ABtraction, abreviated to STAB.\n",

The merged abstractions of the immediately preceding statements of S is the basis for the STAB of S.  In this document the abstraction formed by this initial merge of the abstractions of the immediatly preceding statements is termed a JOIN.

If the lower bound of a variable in the JOIN, has a lower bound of ***Uninitialized*** but an upper bound of which is higher, then a read of this variable is a conditional use of an uninitialized variable.\n",

Otherwise its upper bound is ***Well***.  It cannot be ***Used*** as the assigned variable has not been evaluated yet. If the lower bound of any variables evaluated in determing the assigned value, in the intermediate STAB, is ***Uninitialized*** or ***Ill*** the lower bound, in STAB, of the variable assigned is ***Ill***.  It cannot be ***Uninitialized*** as the variable has been assigned. If the lower bound value of all evaluated variables determining the value assigned, in the intermediate STAB, is greater or equal to ***Well***, i.e., ***Well*** or ***Used***, the assignment is sound and the lower bound of the assigned variable in STAB should be set to ***Well***. \n",

    "## Validity of Model of Definedness\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "***Uninitialized*** < ***Ill*** < ***Well*** < ***Used***.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Uninitialized*** is a special case of  ***Ill*** and ***Used*** is a special case of ***Well***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axioms ###\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A variable may have a definedness value of ***Uninitialized***, ***Ill***, ***Well*** or ***Used*** and the values are considered to be ordered as, ***Uninitialized*** < ***Ill*** < ***Well*** < ***Used***.\n",
    "2. The definedness value of a variable cannot be decreased to ***Uninitialized*** from a higher value.\n",
    "3. A definedness range of a variable is the lowest definedness value the variable may have (lower bound) to the highest value it may have (upper bound), inclusive.  It is denoted by [Lower bound, Upper bound].\n",
    "4. A statement abstraction, STAB, is a set containing a definedness range for each variable used by a subprogram.\n",
    "5. A JOIN of program branches at a statement, S, is a set containing the definedness range of all variables in immediately preceding statements (all branches); the lower bound of the range each variable is the lowest lower bound of the variable has in all the STABs of the immediately preceding statements of S.  The upper bound of the range of each variable is the maximum value the variable has in all of the STABs of the immediately preceding statement of S.\n",
    "6. The initial STAB of a subprogram is determined by the specification of a the subprogram.  Mode **in** or **in out** subprogram formal parameters or globals are considered to be well defined when the subprogram is called and have an initial definedness range of [Well, Well].  All formal paramters and globals of mode **out** are considered to be uninitialized and have an initial definedness range of [Undefined, Undefined].\n",
    "7. A local variable will have an initial definedness range of [Uninitialized, Uninitialized] when it is declared.  An initialization expression of a declaration is considered as an assignment after the declaration.\n",
    "8. Only an ***Assign*** action can instigate a change in the potential definedness value of a variable.  An ***Eval*** action has to be applied to a ***Well*** variable to increase its potential definedness value to ***Used***.\n",
    "11.  A statement applying an ***Assign** action to a variable, V, has the definedness range [Well, Well] if all of the variables evaluated in determining the actual value of V, the defining expression, have a definedness lower bound equal or greater than ***Well***.  If the definedness lower bound of any variable evaluated in the defining expression has a definedess lower bound of less than ***Well*** the definedness lower bound of V is ***Ill***.  If the definedness upper bound of all variables evaluated in the defining expression is less or equal to ***Ill*** then the definedness range of V is [Ill, Ill] otherwise the range of V is [Ill, Well]. \n",
    "12.  It follows from 8 and 9, in order for a variable to have an ***Ill*** value, an expression containing an ***Uninitialized*** value has been used in determining its value.  The value may have been determined directly using an ***Uninitilzed*** variable or indirectly using another variable that has an ***Ill*** value due to its assignment having an Ill-Defined value derived from an expression containing an ***Uninitialized*** variable.  In other words, an ***Ill*** definedness value variable cannot exist without evaluating an ***Uninitialized*** definedness value variable.\n",
    "13.  An ***Eval*** action on a variable can only change the definedness value of the upper bound of its range from ***Well*** to ***Used***, otherwise a ***Eval*** action has no effect on the definedness range of the variable.\n",
    "14.  If the definedness range of a variable is [Uninitialized, Uninitialized] then a ***Eval** of the variable is an unconditional evaluation of an ***Uninitialized*** variable - the value is Ill-Defined.\n",
    "15.  If a variable has lower bound definedness value of ***Uninitialized*** but the upper bound is higher, then a ***Eval*** of the variable is a conditional evaluation of an ***Uninitialized*** variable - the value may be Ill-Defined.\n",
    "16.  If the definedness range of a variable is [Ill, Ill], then a ***Eval*** of the variable is an unconditional evaluation of an ***Ill*** variable - the value will be Ill-Defined.\n",

    "19.  A JOIN of program branches at a statement, S, contains definedness range for all variables in immediately preceding statements (all branches); the lower bound of the range each variable is the lowest lower bound of the variable has in all the STABs of the immediately preceding statements of S.  The upper bound of the range of each variable is the maximum value the variable has in all of the STABs of the immediately preceding statement of S.\n",
    "20.  A STAB of a statement, S, is formed from the JOIN at S by applying:  \n",
    "    a. Applying axioms 2 and 3 to the upper bound of the definedness range, in the JOIN, of each variable having an ***Eval*** action applied by S, resulting in an intermediate STAB,  \n",
    "    b. Applying axioms 9, 10 and 11 to the definedness bounds, in the intermediate STAB, of each variable to which an ***Assign*** action is applied by S, to give the STAB.\n",
    "     \n",
    "The above axioms are summarised in the tables ***Eval*** Action Table and ***Assign*** Action Table given earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is: do these rules ensure that the use of Ill-Defined values are always detected?\n",
    "\n",
    "As ***Uninitialized*** is a special case of ***Ill***, in the following argument, what applies to ***Ill*** applies to ***Uninitialized*** too.  Similarly, ***Used*** is a special case of ***Well***, and what applies to ***Well*** applies to ***Used*** also. \n",
    "  \n",
    "In straight line code (the sequence of statements has no branches) the value of the initial JOIN at a statement, S, is identical to the STAB of the immediately preceding statement of S.  A local variable of a subprogram, L, if it has not been initialized when declared, will have an initial definedness range of [Uninitialized, Uninitialized].  If there are no assignments of any form to L in the preceding statements of S, L's range will remain [Uninitialized, Uninitialized] and a ***Eval*** action on L will indicate the unconditional ***Eval*** of an ***Uninitialized*** and therefore Ill-Defined variable.  The use of an uninitialized local variable will always be detected.  If this were not the case either:\n",
    "1. The local variable has been Well-Defined when declared without initialization.  This is a contradiction of axiom 1.\n",
    "2. The definedness range of the local variable has been changed. From axiom 9 this can only be acheived by an ***Assign*** action by some form of assignment in the preceding statements.  This is also a contradiction as the hypothesis was that there were no assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar argument is true for subprogram parameters and globals which have a mode of **out** as these types of variables also have an initial range of [Uninitialized, Uninitialized] as specified in axiom 1.\n",

The JOIN at a point, P, is formed by creating the widest possible range of each variable in the subprogram from the minimum and maximum range values from the STAB of the last statement of all of the branches joining at P, as given in axiom 13.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since ***Uninitialized*** is the lowest definedness value, any branch joining at point P having a STAB with a variable, V, that has a lower bound of ***Uninitialized***, V will have the same lower bound in the JOIN at P.  \n",

    "If instead, V has an upper bound in greater than  ***Uninitialized*** in the STAB of any branch joining at P, then the upper bound in JOIN will be the greatest upper bound (GUB) of V from the STABs of all of the branches joining at P.  The range of V in the JOIN at P will be [Uninitialized, GUB].

A representation of the values of definedness needs to be used.\n",

    "The value of a variable is \"used\" if its name appears in an Expression.  The value of a variable may be \"defined\", generally by an assignment.  Consider a model to represent the values of definedness. Definedness is not concerned with the actual value of a variable, only whether it is initialized.  Three values are obvious: Uninitialized, Defined and Used. However, the analysis has to detect the use of an uninitialized variable and the update of a variable with an expression containing an uninitialized variable.  To track these anomalies three extra values are introduced, giving the following Definedness values a variable may take:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uninitialized      -- An uninitialized variable\n",
    "2. UD_Used        -- A variable that has been used while Undefined\n",

    "4. US_Used        -- A variable that has been used while Unsound\n",

    "7. Used           -- A Defined variable that has been used\n",
    "\n",
    "Undefined, the variable has not been assigned a sound value, UD_Used, the variable has been used while Undefined, Unsound, the variable has been updated with an Undefined or Unsound value, US_Used, the variable has been used whilst it is Unsound, Defined, the variable has been updated with a value not dependent on an Undefined or Unsound value, and Used, the variable has a Defined value and it has been used. The value Unsound represents a value derived from an Undefined or Unsound value.  If a definedness value is not Undefined, UD_Used, Unsound, or US_Used, it is considered a Sound value. A Sound value is not necessarily a Valid value in the Ada sense as a value could be out of range and, therefore, an invalid value.  A more sophisticated abstract interpretation technique may be able to approximate the range of values a variable may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statements of a subprogram read (a use) or Assign (a definition) variables. The read of a variable with an undefined value is erroneous and the read of a variable with an unsound value is of questionable Validity.  Two successive Assignments to the same variable without an intervening read of the variable means (in SPARK) that the value of the first assignment is unused and therefore may suggest a programming mistake. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a single statement, a variable may be both read and assigned, but in SPARK, expressions do not have side effects, so all the variables on the right-hand side of an assignment statement are only used.  On the left-hand side, only array indices are used, although unusually, in object declarations, more than one variable may be initialized.  In a subprogram call, formal parameters of mode **in** or **in out** are modelled as uses of the corresponding actual parameters and a definition of the formal parameters.  Similarly, formal parameters of mode **out** or **in out** are modelled as a definition of the corresponding actual parameters in a procedure call statement.  A subprogram can have many parameters and globals, leading to the model of a statement potentially having multiple uses of variables (possibly of the same variable) and multiple definitions of variables.  All variables defined in a single statement are unique.\n",

The abstraction of the statement is formed by merging the abstractions of all immediately preceding statements and applying the effects of the current statement.  Commonly, an abstraction has a notion of the range of values that a variable may have at the statement.  For definedness, the maximum range is [Undefined, Used], although in definedness there is not necessarily an order to these possible values but, for simplicity, an order is assumed Undefined < UD_Used, Unsound < US_Used < Defined < Used.  A merge has to take the abstractions from the immediately preceding statements and the translation of the statement from this pair of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, consider merging the immediately preceding statements.  This part of the merge determines the widest range of values the variable could take from the abstractions of all of its immediately preceding statements.  That is, the lower bound is taken to be the lowest bound of all its immediate predecessors and the high bound from the highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, consider the variables read by the statement.  SPARK flow analysis reports on all uses of an uninitialized variable, whether unconditional (it will always happen when executing the program) or conditional (it happens depending on the execution path taken when the program is run). The abstract interpretation model of definedness needs to do this too.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a variable read by a statement has a range in the merged abstractions of immediately preceding statements of [Undefined, Undefined], then this is an unconditional use of an uninitialized variable and should be reported.  In this case, the range becomes [Undefined, UD_Used].  If the lower bound of the variable in the merged abstractions of preceding statements is undefined but the upper bound is defined or used, then this is the conditional use of an uninitialized variable and should be reported as such.  The lower bound should remain as undefined as the use of the variable has not changed this, however, if the upper bound is defined or used, it should become used as the previously defined or used variable has been read.\n",
