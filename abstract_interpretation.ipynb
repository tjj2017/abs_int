    "Traditionally, SPARK programs have been analysed by the Examiner using data flow and information flow analysis.  This study does not consider the proof features of the Examiner (VCG generator) but rather investigates whether the same or better results to flow analysis can be achieved using abstract interpretation. Better results may be achievable using abstract interpretation as it might be possible to determine some non-executable paths and exclude them from the analysis.  To achieve this goal, two of the more advanced techniques of abstract interpretation - variable analysis and path analysis are needed. \n",

    "## Abstract Interpretation\n",
    "Abstract interpretation is commonly viewed as having three stages:\n",
    "1. Translate\n",
    "2. Merge\n",
    "3. Widen\n",
    "\n",
    "These three stages are applied to each statement of the given source text until it has been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translate converts a statement into a simple model representing the statement.  Merge takes the model of the statement and the abstractions of the immediately preceding statements (in general, there may be more than one due to gotos if statements and loops) and merges them into a single abstraction for the statement.  The abstraction is an approximation of the state at the statement.  Generally, it consists of an entry for each variable and an approximation of the range of values that variable may have at the statement.  The Widen stage is typically used after loops to widen the approximate range of possible values a variable may have to represent executing the loop multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is interesting about these stages is that they can be adapted to suit a number of different analyses but still fit within the framework of calling each of the three stages for each statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance,  constant analysis is may be used to obtain an approximation of the range of values a variable may have at a particular statement based on the value of constants within the source text.  Variable analysis is similar but more complex based on the expressions assigned to variables within the source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform abstract interpretation, an abstract model of the source text needs to be constructed consisting of a model of each statement (the translation) and a sequence of abstractions representing each of the previous statements.  Merge consolidates the immediately preceding statements with the model of the current statement to obtain an abstraction for the current statement which is appended to the sequence.  Merging is a simple operation when the statement has only one immediate predecessor but becomes a little more complex around if statements, loops and the targets of goto statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "SPARK has the advantage over general programming language in that, other than in a loop, an immediately preceding statement cannot be later in text than the current statement, simplifying the sequence of preceding statements that need to be maintained.  As SPARK is modular and each subprogram is essentially self-contained and only variables used within the subprogram need to be in the abstractions, very little extra context has to be maintained and the sequence of abstractions can be discarded after completing the analysis of the subprogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study starts with the simple but very important check for SPARK variable defindness.   In Ada terms, ideally is every variable initialised to a valid value before it is read.  "

    "## Abstract Interpretation of Defindness\n",
    "Abstract interpretaion uses an abstraction based on an approximation the range of values a variable may have at a given statement.  In variable defindness we are concerned whether a variable has been assigned a (preferably valid) value but are not concerned with the precise value.  A representatation of the values of defindness needs to used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a model to represent the values of defindness. Each variable may have a few possible values:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uninitialized\n",
    "2. Unsound\n",
    "3. Assigned\n",
    "4. Read\n",
    "\n",
    "Uninitalized, the variable has not been assigned a value, Unsound, the variable has been assigned an Unitialized or Unsound value, Assigned the variable has been assigned a value not dependent on an uninitialized or unsound value and Read, the variable has been read. The value Unsound represents a value that has been derived from an Unintialized value.  An Assigned value is not necessarily a Valid value in the Ada sense as a value could be Assigned to a variable which is out of range and therefore an invalid value.  A more sophisticated abstract interpretation technique may be able to approximate the range of values a variable may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statements of a subprogram Read or Assign variables. The Read of a variable with an Uninitialized value is erroneous and the Read of a variable with an Unsound value is of questionable Validity.  Two successive Assignments to the same variable without an intervening Read of the variable means (in SPARK) the value of the first assignment is unused and therefore may suggest a programming mistake. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a single statement a variable may be both read and assigned but in SPARK expressions do not have side-effects so the all the variables on the right hand side of an assignment statement are only Read.  On the left hand side only array indices are Read although, unusually in object dclarations, more than one variable may be assigned.  In a subprogram call, formal parameters of mode **in** or **in out** are modelled as Reads of the corresponding actual parameters.  Similarly, formal paramaters of mode **out** or **in out** are modelled as Assignment to the corresponding actual actual parameters in a procedure call statement.  A subprogram can have many parameters and globals leading to the model of a statement potentially having multiple Reads of variables (possibly of the same variable) and multiple Assignments of variables.  All assignments in a single statement are to unique variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed translation first considers all of variables read by the statement and then those that are assigned by the statement. This avoids ambiguity when the same variable is both read and written by the statement.  Each read and assignment of a variable will have a separate entry in the translation.  For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    X := X + X + Y;\n",
    "\n",
    "would be translated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Read_Var   (X)\n",
    "    Read_Var   (X)\n",
    "    Read_Var   (Y)\n",
    "    Assign_Var (X)\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep an association between the translation and the statement a position and a translation item is needed.  For simplicity, in this study, only one statement per line is assumed and so the can just be the line number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the above statement is on line 10, the translation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Read   (X, (10, 1))\n",
    "    Read_  (X, (10, 2))\n",
    "    Read   (Y, (10, 3))\n",
    "    Assign (X, (10, 4))\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be necessary to record the two Reads of X, one may be sufficient as a Read does not change the state of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call of a procedure, \n",
    "\n",
    "**procedure** P (A : **in** Integer; B : **in out** Integer; C : **out** Integer);\n",
    "\n",
    "on line 20\n",
    "\n",
    "    P (X, Y, X);\n",
    "\n",
    "would be translated as (assuming no dependency relation given):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Read_Var   (X, (20, 1))\n",
    "    Read_Var   (Y, (20, 2))\n",
    "    Assign_Var (Y, (20, 3))\n",
    "    Read_Var   (X, (20, 4))\n",
    "    Read_Var   (Y, (20, 5))\n",
    "    Assign_Var (X, (20, 6))\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that the Reads of variables use the value of the variable from the merged value of the immidiately preceding statements rather than the values Assigned in the by the procedure call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each statement has an abstraction representing the state of all variables on completion of execution of the statement.  The abstraction at the statement is formed by the merging the abstractions of all immediately preceding statements and applying the effects of the current statement.  Commonly, an abstraction has a notion of the range of values that a variable may have at the statement.  For defindness the maximum range is [Uninitalized, Assigned], athough in defindness there is not necessarily an order to these posible values but for simplicity an oreder is assumed Unintialized < Unsound < Assigned < Read.  A merge has to take the abstractions from the immediately preceding statements and the translation of the statement form this pair of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "First consider the merge of the immediately preceding statements.  This part of the merge determines the widest range of values that the variable could take from the abstractions of all of its immediately preceding statements.  That is, the lower bound is taken to be lowest bound of all its immediate predecessors and the high bound from the highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next consider the variables that are Read by the statement.  SPARK flow analysis reports on all uses of an uninialized variable, whether this be unconditional (it will always happen when executing the program) or conditional (it will happen dependent on the excution path taken when the program is run). The abstract interpretation model of defindness needs to do this too.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a variable Read by a statement has a range in the merged immediately prceeding statements of [Uninitialized, Uninitialized], then this is clearly an unconditional Read of an Uninitialized variable and should be reported.  In this case the range remains as [Uninitialized, Uninitialized] as a Read of the variable does not change its value - it is still Uninitialized.  If the lower bound of the variable in the merged statements is Uninitialized but the upper bound is Assigned or Read, then this is the conditional use of an uninitialized variable and should be reported as such.  The lower bound should remain as Uninitialized as the Read of the variable has not changed this, however if the upper bound is Assigned or Read it should become Read as the previously Assigned or Read variable has been Read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the range of a Unsound variable is similar.  If the range of the variable is [Uninitialized, Unsound] or [Unsound, Unsound] then a Read of the variable does not change its value.  If the range of the variable is [Unsound, Assigned] then it becomes [Unsound, Read] after the Read of the variable and a variable with the range [Unsound, Read] remains unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary here are the rules for the effects of a Read of a variable on the variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Merged Bounds                   <Read_Var  New Bounds   \n",
    "    [Uninitialized, Uninitialized]     ->     [Uninitialized, Uninitialized] (1)\n",

    "    [Unsound, Unsound]                 ->     [Unsound, Unsound]\n",
    "    [Unsound, Assigned]                ->     [Unsound, Read]\n",

    "It is not clear that a message should be issued yet regarding the Read of an Unsound variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning to a variable potentially changes its value dependent on any variables Read in determining its (defindness) value.  SPARK flow analysis also reports on two successive assignments to a variable without an intervining read of the variable.   The value of the first assignment is not used and may be a mistake in the program.  Such assignments should be detected with abstract interpretation too.\n",
    "\n",
    "First consider bounds of the Read variables in this statement, after the Read variable action has been applied as described above, that are used in determing the defindness value of the assignment.  If any of bounds of the variables Read have a lower bound of less than Assigned, the the value is questionable and the lower bound of the assignment value should set to Unsound.  If the upper bound is Uninitialized or Unsound, then the upper bound should also be set to Unsound as the (actual as opposed to defindness) value assigned must have an Unsound defindness value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary the effects of the variables Read in determiming the value of the assignment are below but only the possible bounds as given above are included:\n",
